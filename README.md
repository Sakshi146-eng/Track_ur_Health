# ü©∫ Track_ur_Health 

An AI-powered disease prediction system that analyzes symptoms to provide potential diagnoses, treatment options, and medical recommendations.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Symptom Analysis**: Advanced parsing and processing of user-reported symptoms
- **Predictive Diagnostics**: AI-based prediction of potential diseases based on symptom patterns
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Suggested treatment options based on predicted conditions
- **Specialist Referrals**: Recommendations for appropriate medical specialists
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of condition severity and risk levels
- **Preventive Measures**: Customized prevention tips for identified conditions

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Track_ur_Health.git
   cd Track_ur_Health
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Run the web interface

```bash
python main.py
```

The Gradio interface will be available at link generated

You'll see an interactive interface where you can:
- Enter symptoms separated by commas
- Adjust the number of results you want to see
- Get predictions along with medical recommendations

### Use the predictor in your code

```python
from disease_predictor import EnhancedDiseasePredictor

# Initialize the predictor with the included dataset
predictor = EnhancedDiseasePredictor('dataset.csv')

# Or use your own dataset with the same column structure
# predictor = EnhancedDiseasePredictor('your_custom_dataset.csv')

# Predict diseases from symptoms
symptoms = "fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose"
predictions = predictor.predict_disease(symptoms, top_n=3)

# Get recommendations for the top prediction
recommendations = predictor.generate_recommendations(predictions[0]['disease'])

print(f"Top prediction: {predictions[0]['disease']} with {predictions[0]['probability']:.1f}% confidence")
print(f"Recommended treatments: {recommendations['cures']}")
print(f"Consult: {recommendations['doctors']}")
```

## üìä Dataset Format

The repository includes a `dataset.csv` file ready to use. If you want to use your own dataset, ensure it has the following columns:

| Column Name | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| disease | Name of the medical condition | Influenza |
| symptoms | Comma-separated list of symptoms | fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose |
| cures | Comma-separated list of treatments | rest, fluids, antiviral medication |
| doctor | Medical specialists to consult | General Practitioner, Infectious Disease Specialist |
| risk level | Severity of the condition | moderate |

## üß† Model Details

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Preprocessing**: Advanced text cleaning, lemmatization, and medical term preservation
